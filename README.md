# Jeopardy


Python version of one my favorite gameshows, Jeopardy!
-----------------------------------------------------
**Jeopardy** is a Python **command line** remake of the classic gameshow, Jeopardy!
The questions are common knowledge questions. The lower the question value, the easier the question is. The higher the question value, the harder the question is.

The following features are NOT a part of the standard jeopardy game but ARE implemented:

The following features are NOT a part of the standard jeopardy game but could be implemented:

Other Notes:
> This is/was my first ever time using Python and I thought this would be good opportunity to learn some of the basic ins and outs of Python.
> In the future, if able, I will look into adding UI to resemble the Jeopardy screen!
